Data Science Project

This project is worked upon AirBnB Data which has three different datasets
1. Listings.csv, which gives you details related to listings of hotels
2. reviews - All related to reviews of each site
3. calendar - listing of each propery along calendar days

The business use case which i was trying to understand is

1. find which are the most correlated features for defining price
2. Create a regression model to define price of a property
3. Visualize trend of Price across States to understand which area is the most contributing

I have tried to follow CRISP-DM Process

Steps Involved
1. Analyse the given dataset - Listings.csv
2. Cleaning the data- Clean the data which have null values by using the techniues mentioned in the course
3. Create a correlation plot to analyze which are the most relevant features which answers my question1
4. Create a linear regression model and try to predict the prices
5. Analyze the rsquare value and confirm if this model can be taken forward
